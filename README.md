# API Documentation

The purpose of this project is to provide a production environment for testing locally.

All API URLs are on HTTPS. The certificate is generated by OpenSSL, so you must accept it in your browser before proceeding.

## Private API

- **URL**: 
  - `https://localhost/private`
  - `https://birder.epita.fr/private` (you need to change the hosts file on your machine as we don't own the domain name)
- **Login**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

You will be prompted to a Swagger doc where you can test the APIs. An authorization access token is required, which is available at Keycloak.

## Public API

- **URL**:
  - `http://localhost/public`
  - `https://birder.epita.fr/public` (you need to change the hosts file on your machine as we don't own the domain name)

You will be prompted to a Swagger doc where you can test the APIs.
